The temporal study was done by using Matlab. C programming was used to find the simulation data for the spatio-temporal patterns for different parameter values.

# Description of the data and file structure
Separate directories were created for each figure, and the code and results were kept in the same directory. The plots can be generated by running the Matlab code in the directory, e.g., Fig_1.m is for the Fig.1 in Fig1 directory.  


# Code/Software
Parallel C code was used to get the simulation data, and MATLAB was used to visualise the results.
